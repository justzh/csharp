Identifier names

An identifier is the name you assign to a type (class, interface, struct, delegate, or enum), member, variable, or namespace. Valid identifiers must follow these rules:
	- Identifiers must start with a letter, or _.
	- Identifiers may contain Unicode letter characters, decimal digit characters, Unicode connecting characters, Unicode combining characters, or Unicode formatting characters.
	- You can declare identifiers that match C# keywords by using the @ prefix on the identifier.


Naming Conventions

	- Interface names start with a capital I
	- Attribute types end with the word Attribute
	- Enum types use a singular noun for non-flags, and a plural noun for flags.
	- Identifiers should not contain two consecutive _ characters. Those names are reserved for compiler generated identifiers.
